# Intro

This is a simple script that downloads a bunch of tools I use to develop.

# Why

I constantly wipe my computer for security and tidiness, and I found myself spending a lot of time downloading the same tools. I decided to write this scripts that does most the installation for me. 

# How to Use

```bash
cd boot
chmod +x zsh.sh
./zsh.sh
chmod +x boot.sh
./boot.sh
```

## Why two scripts?
Installing zsh stops all of bash from running and begins anew.  
If anyone can figure out a way to get zsh to run the rest of the boot.sh scripts, then I would gladly merge their branch.
